# OpenCV with CUDA Docker Image
This repository contains Dockerfiles for creating Docker images of the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) computer vision library with NVIDIA CUDA support 
based on the [official CUDA images](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/).

## Requirements
To build and run these containers leveraging NVIDIA GPUs, you need the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).
